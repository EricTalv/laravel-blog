## Project Description 

Create a blogging system with laravel and vue 

## Project Status

This project was my own curiosity into building APIs, laravels eco-system,
front-end + back-end workflow.

The project included a front-end view of all the posts using
a bootstrap blog template.

I also had a feature post, tags specific search.

Overall I was pretty happy of how the project was going,
though life eventually got in the way and I had to go on hiatus for a while.

Coming back the composer was so out-of-date I couldnÂ´t get the site 
back up and running.

Though not finished, I am still proud of how far I 

got with it and the valuable stuff I learned.

## Tech used 

- vue.js
