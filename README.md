## About This Project

This is a part of my *100-days-of-code* challenge,

The prospect of this project should be a full fledged simple blog 
based around and on laravel and vue technologies.

## Vision

MVP: Blog post must include: 
 - Index of articles
 - One article page view
 - Create article view
 - Update article view
 - Delete article button
 - Tags on posts
 - Tag view page 

<s>Deadline: 13.11.20</s> 
_New Deadline: 18.11.20 _
